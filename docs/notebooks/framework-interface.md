Having prepared a C++ framework for 13 TeV Open Data analysis, this part of the project involves creating an interface based on the framework. The user interface are shown in the figure above. To take advantage of the Jupyter Notebook to create educational and training material that can be easy to use and share. From this interface, analysis code and instructions written in Markdown give users a better understanding of the algorithms in the C++ frameworks to analyze and plot like a real physicist.  

Reproduction could be done through both ATLAS Open Data Virtual Machine and cloud computing services such as MyBinder and SWAN. Availability on Virtual Machine and MyBinder provide the the possibility for non CERN-users to execute and developed these analysis. The aim is to inspire others to create new notebooks too: ATLAS and not-ATLAS members can consider to use notebooks as a complementary way to create educational resources (like tutorials) and share those with us for distribution into the ATLAS Open Data website. We want to encourage developers and students to share their notebooks and ideas under the ATLAS Open Data platform.
The combination of notebooks with other online and offline resources looks like a promising channel to do outreach within and outside ATLAS and any other scientific community.
