# Welcome to the ATLAS Open Data Hackathon

This is a documentation to run the resources to-be-released at the [ATLAS Open Data](http://opendata.atlas.cern) project!

# Data and MonteCarlo samples at 13 TeV centre-of-mass energy

- **8 TeV Run 1** samples
 * http://opendata.atlas.cern/extendedanalysis/datasets.php
    * You can get/read one by one, using the URL, from a Jupyter notebook, for example.
    * Or download the ZIP file with all in there.

    * Please, avoid any modification, you can simply read directly using LXPLUS (use it as *read-only* area).
    * You need to subscribe to the e-group â€œatlas-outreach-data-and-tools" to get access.

**Notes**
* We develop the 13 TeV ```TTree``` to be compatible with the 8 TeV ```TTree```.
* This means that in case something is developed using the 8 TeV samples, can be easily modified to fit the 13 TeV ```TTree```.


## What are they?
* They are several collections of samples.
* The collections are defined by the filters that were applied.
* Those filters are:
   * **1lep**
     * MC (55G)
     * Data (54G)
   * **2lep**
     * MC (32G)
     * Data (2.5G)
   * **GamGam**
     * MC (635M)
     * Data (1.4G)
   * **1lep1tau**
     * MC (886M)
     * Data (204M)
   * **1tau**
     * Data (191M)
     * MC (107M)
   * **2tau**
     * MC (36M)
     * Data (55M)
   * **1fatjet1lep**
     * Data (11M)
     * MC (6.0G)

* More details about the samples, production status can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zPlEUikKfXJhqD_LohXQ5x85n9gPPV69tUlngGt2gWo/edit#gid=4912678).
